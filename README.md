C++ Encryption/Decryption Program
==========

The Encryption and Decryption is done by Letter Shifting Method. For example:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]\[

When the shift value is +3 the value of A will be D and so on. And the decryption is also on the same basis. More description is written in the file encdec.cpp.
